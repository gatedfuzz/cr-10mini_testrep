# cr-10mini_testrep
going to attempt to use this to help keep track of my working settings on configuration files for my cr-10mini 3d printer in VS Code 

im having an odd time learning my cr-10mini 3d printer, as i am also having an odd time learning how to do more than just search github for things to mess with.
i want to learn to use VScode, use my 3d printer effectively, fully utilize and understand what github can do, and maybe one day help someone with anything I find or figure out. plus this seems like a great place to store any working configuration files for merlin. i have no idea what i am doing at this point so im just going to try and get four or five birds stoned at once with this.

if anyone sees this and wants to contribute, please do. if anyone sees this and wants to tell me what i am doing right or wrong, please do.
 now lets see if i can accomplish more than a ridiculously sad readme file.
